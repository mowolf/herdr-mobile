# Running the gateway

The gateway is `gateway/server.py`: one Python file, standard library only. It
serves `web/` to your phone and proxies everything else onto Herdr's UNIX
socket. `openssl` is shelled out to for push signing; nothing else is needed.

## Requirements

* Python 3.10+
* A running [Herdr](https://herdr.dev) session or server on the same machine
* [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com), if you want to reach it from the phone

## Run it by hand

```bash
python3 gateway/server.py
```

It listens on `127.0.0.1:3009`. Two knobs, both environment variables:

| | |
|---|---|
| `SHEEPIT_PORT` | Port to listen on. Default `3009`. (`PORT` also works.) |
| `HOST` | Interface to bind. Default `127.0.0.1` — Tailscale Serve fronts it, so it does not need to be reachable itself. |

Herdr's socket is found automatically: `HERDR_SOCKET` if set, otherwise
`~/.config/herdr/herdr.sock`, falling back to `/root/.config/herdr/herdr.sock`.

> **fish shell:** `VAR=value python3 …` does not set the variable in fish. Use
> `env SHEEPIT_PORT=3009 python3 gateway/server.py`.

## Autostart

### macOS — the menu bar app (recommended)

```bash
make -C menubar login
```

One switch that runs the gateway, starts `herdr server` if nothing is
listening, brings Tailscale up, and holds `caffeinate -s` so the Mac stays
awake — an asleep Mac cannot deliver a push notification. See
[menubar/README.md](../menubar/README.md).

Turning it off leaves Herdr running: the headless server holds every open pane
and agent, so stopping that is `herdr server stop`, never a side effect of the
switch. The menu bar app and the launchd agent below cannot both own the port —
use one or the other.

### macOS — launchd

```bash
sed "s|SHEEPIT_DIR|$PWD|g" deploy/com.sheepit.gateway.plist \
  > ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.sheepit.gateway.plist
launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.sheepit.gateway.plist
```

Logs land in `sheepit.log` in the repository. To inspect, restart or remove:

```bash
launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/com.sheepit.gateway
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.sheepit.gateway
launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u)/com.sheepit.gateway
```

The unit runs `/usr/bin/python3` — system Python — rather than a Homebrew one
deliberately: the macOS application firewall ships with `/usr/bin/python3`
allowed for incoming connections while a Homebrew interpreter is not, so a
Homebrew-launched server can be silently unreachable from other devices.

### Linux — systemd

```bash
sudo cp deploy/sheepit.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now sheepit.service
```

Edit the paths in the unit first; it assumes `/root/projects/sheepit`.

## Reaching it from the phone

```bash
tailscale serve --bg --https=8443 http://127.0.0.1:3009
```

Then open `https://<node>.<tailnet>.ts.net:8443` on the phone — find the exact
name with `tailscale status --json | grep DNSName` — and **Share → Add to Home
Screen**. Installing it to the home screen is not optional if you want
notifications: Web Push does not work in a Safari tab, only in an installed web
app.

> **Prerequisite:** HTTPS certificates must be enabled for your tailnet (admin
> console → **DNS** → **HTTPS Certificates** → Enable). Without it,
> `tailscale serve --https` hangs and writes no config, and `tailscale cert`
> reports *"your Tailscale account does not support getting TLS certs"*. Check
> with `tailscale status --json | grep CertDomains`: it must list your node,
> not `null`.

## Sharing the tailnet with dev servers

Agents start dev servers, and they all want port 3000. This is why the gateway
defaults to **3009** and to HTTPS port **8443**: standard `443` stays free for
whatever an agent is previewing.

Tailscale is a mesh VPN, and the `tailscale0` firewall accepts traffic from
your own tailnet, so any dev server bound to `0.0.0.0` is already reachable
from the phone over plain HTTP — no proxy needed:

```text
http://<node>.<tailnet>.ts.net:3000     Next.js, Nuxt
http://<node>.<tailnet>.ts.net:5173     Vite
http://<node>.<tailnet>.ts.net:8000     FastAPI, Flask
```

Only the home-screen app needs HTTPS through Serve, because installation and
microphone access require a secure context.

Serve can also split one port by path:

```bash
tailscale serve --bg --set-path /sheepit http://127.0.0.1:3009
tailscale serve --bg --set-path /preview http://127.0.0.1:5173
```

Useful commands:

```bash
tailscale serve status           # what is routed where
tailscale serve status --json    # the raw table
tailscale serve --https=8443 off # drop one proxy
tailscale serve reset            # drop all of them
```

## Implementation notes

* **Percent-encoded pane ids.** Mobile Safari encodes the colon in `w1:p2` as
  `w1%3Ap2`; the gateway unquotes path components before passing targets to
  Herdr.
* **The keyboard.** The viewport uses `interactive-widget=resizes-content` and
  `viewport-fit=cover`, and the layout height is driven from `visualViewport`,
  because iOS does not reliably reflow a fixed `dvh` layout when the keyboard
  opens — the header would slide off screen.
* **Battery.** Polling stops on `visibilitychange` when the phone locks or
  Safari is backgrounded, and resumes with an immediate refresh on wake.
* **Caching.** Assets are served with a strong `ETag` and
  `no-cache, must-revalidate`; without a validator iOS will happily strand a
  home-screen install on an old build.
