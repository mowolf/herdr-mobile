# Notifications on iOS

Get told the moment an agent stops working — off your tailnet, on cellular,
with the phone locked.

## Turning them on

1. **Install the app to the home screen.** Web Push does not work in a Safari
   tab, only in an installed web app (iOS 16.4+).
2. Open it from the home screen, then **gear → Notify when an agent finishes**,
   and accept the iOS prompt.

Delivery goes through Apple's push service rather than your tailnet, which is
why it reaches you away from home. The gateway has to be awake to send it: on a
laptop that sleeps, run `caffeinate -s` — or use the
[menu bar app](../menubar/README.md), which holds it for you.

The same permission drives the count on the home screen icon. Without it the
badge silently never appears; see [design.md](design.md#the-home-screen-icon).

## What it needs

The `openssl` binary, present on macOS and most Linux hosts. Python's standard
library has no ECDSA, so the VAPID JWT is signed by shelling out to it. No pip
packages, no service account, no third party.

VAPID keys and device subscriptions are generated on first use and stored mode
`600` in `~/.config/sheepit/` — override with `SHEEPIT_STATE_DIR`. They live
outside the repository and must never be committed. `SHEEPIT_PUSH_SUB` sets the
RFC 8292 contact sent to the push service.

## Why notifications carry no payload

Encrypting a push payload needs ECDH plus AES-GCM, which the standard library
cannot do. Rather than take a dependency, SheepIt sends an empty push and lets
the service worker do the work: on wake, `sw.js` fetches `/api/agents` and
names whichever agent stopped, so the notification still shows the real project
name — it just fetches it rather than being told.

The same handler sets the badge count, and collapses repeats into one
notification so a burst of finishing agents does not become a burst of alerts.

## Testing and troubleshooting

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3009/api/push/test
```

`201` means the push service accepted it. `404` or `410` mean the subscription
is dead — the gateway drops it automatically, and the phone will re-subscribe
next time you open the app.

If nothing arrives at all, work through these in order:

* Is the app installed to the home screen, rather than open in a tab?
* Is the Mac awake? An asleep machine sends nothing and reports no error.
* Did the permission prompt get denied once? iOS will not ask again — clear it
  under **Settings → Notifications**, or remove and re-add the app.

## Custom sounds are not possible

The Notification API's `sound` property was dropped from the standard in 2018
for want of implementations, and iOS plays its own system sound for web push
regardless. Nothing in the service worker can change it. SheepIt's
[bleat](design.md#the-bleat) is therefore a foreground sound only.
