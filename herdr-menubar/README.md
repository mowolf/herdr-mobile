# SheepIt.app

The macOS half of **Sheep It**: a menu bar switch for the herdr-mobile gateway
on Apple Silicon.

One toggle drives the four things the phone needs, which otherwise have to be
started by hand and drift out of step:

| | |
|---|---|
| **Herdr** | `herdr server` is started if no server is listening — the gateway is only a proxy onto its socket, so without it the phone shows nothing |
| **Gateway** | runs `server.py` on `127.0.0.1:3009` |
| **Tailscale** | brought up if it is stopped — the phone reaches the gateway over the tailnet |
| **`caffeinate -s`** | an asleep Mac cannot send a push notification, so alerts silently never arrive |

The bar icon is the Sheep It sheep, drawn in code rather than bundled as an
asset: solid when the gateway is running, slashed and dimmed when it is off. It
is a template image, so the menu bar tints it for light and dark - which is why
the head is told from the fleece by a cut-out gap rather than by colour.

The Finder icon is the phone's home screen sheep. `make-icns.py` wraps
`static/icon.svg` in the rounded rectangle macOS expects - unlike iOS, macOS
does not mask an icon for you - and rasterises it with `qlmanage`, so there is
one sheep to edit rather than two.

## Build

```bash
make          # build/SheepIt.app
make run      # build and launch
make install  # copy to /Applications
make login    # install and start at login
make unlogin  # stop starting at login
```

`make login` installs a small LaunchAgent that runs `open -a SheepIt`
rather than adding a Login Item: scripting System Events to add one requires
Automation permission that a script cannot prompt for. `open` re-uses a running
instance, so logging in never starts a second copy.

No Xcode project and no dependencies — a single `clang` invocation against
AppKit. It is written in Objective-C rather than Swift deliberately: Command
Line Tools installs that carry a stale `SwiftBridging` modulemap fail every
Swift AppKit build, and clang is unaffected.

### Replacing an older build

The menu bar icon is drawn by the binary, so **a copy left running keeps
drawing its own icon** however many times the app is replaced on disk - which
is what makes a rebuild look like it did nothing. `make install` therefore
quits any running copy first, and also removes the app and LaunchAgent under
the previous `HerdrMenuBar` / `com.herdr.menubar` names, so the rename does not
leave two sheep in the bar. Relaunch with `make run`, or `make login` to
reinstate the login agent under its new label.

Finder caches app icons separately: if it still shows the old one after the
install, `killall Finder`.

## Notes

`server.py` is located by walking up from the bundle, so a build inside the
repository finds it automatically. Override with the `serverPath` user default
or the `HERDR_SERVER` environment variable; `HERDR_PORT` changes the port.

Herdr is found at the usual install locations rather than through `PATH`: a
GUI app inherits launchd's minimal environment, not the login shell's. Override
with the `herdrPath` user default or `HERDR_BIN`. Liveness is a `connect()` to
`~/.config/herdr/herdr.sock` (`HERDR_SOCKET` wins), so a socket file left
behind by a crash does not read as running.

Turning the switch off does not stop Herdr, and neither does quitting: the
headless server holds every pane and agent that is open, so tearing it down is
`herdr server stop`, never a side effect of the toggle.

The app and the launchd agent cannot both own the port. If you use this app,
remove the agent:

```bash
launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u)/com.herdr.mobile
rm ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.herdr.mobile.plist
```

An orphaned gateway from a previous run is reclaimed automatically — but only
after confirming it is running the same `server.py`, never an unrelated
process. `caffeinate` is started with `-w <pid>`, so it exits with the app even
if the app is killed, rather than holding the Mac awake indefinitely.
